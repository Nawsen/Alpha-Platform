# Alpha-Platform

A platform to manage people and inventory in a whole new way!

## Technical

This is a SAAS-solution with Ionic 3 & Angular as a frontend and Google Firebase as a backend.
Ionic will support us to create native applications for all major mobile devices, ranging from phones to tablets.
While still giving a great web experience.
Google Firebase is used for: Hosting, security, file storage and data storage.

## Target

This application strives to be the sole application needed to manage your crew and their check in & out times.
While also giving you an overview of the items you have lended out to a crew-member and how many you have still left to lend out.
